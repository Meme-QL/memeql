Pending user stories:<br>
As a user, I need to be able to use the application in dark mode, the brightness burns.<br>
As a user, I need to be able to search and user tags to discover content.<br>
As an app owner, I need to have content moderation in place to prevent uploads of malicious content (this will be provided by Azure AI Content Safety).<br>
As a user, I want to be able to share a link that takes my friend directly to a specific meme.<br>
As a user, I want to use an already existing social login for MemeQL.<br>
As a user, I do not want to write descriptions or tags, I should simply review the output of a generative AI.<br>
